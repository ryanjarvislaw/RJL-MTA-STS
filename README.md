# MTA-STS Policy for Ryan Jarvis Law¬Æ

Welcome to the official repository for the MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent-Strict Transport Security) policy for Ryan Jarvis Law¬Æ. As a lawyer that prioritises the security and privacy of my communications, I've dedicated this space to host my MTA-STS policy file, an essential measure for enhancing email security through encryption in transit and guarding against common vulnerabilities.

## üõ°Ô∏è About MTA-STS

MTA-STS is a security standard that I implement to ensure the safety of email exchanges. It enables email servers to declare their capability for SMTP-over-TLS connections, allowing sender servers to verify TLS support before connecting. This protocol is crucial for preventing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) and downgrade attacks, protecting emails from interception and tampering during transit.

For an in-depth understanding of MTA-STS and its importance, you can visit the [Opportunistic TLS Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS).
